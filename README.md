# edge-os

`edge-os` gathers a bunch of tools for edge device hackers to manage their edge machines without having to configure port-forwarding.

A fully hosted version can be found here at [edge.sailoi.com](https://edge.sailoi.com/). I will come up with a dockerized version of server later on.

It should also address many common features that's absolutely required when it comes to scaling up with edge machines.

I will gradually add in code when I am not working on my day job.
